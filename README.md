To ensure seamless database connectivity with MySQL within the Apache Tomcat environment provided by XAMPP, it's essential to include the MySQL Connector/JAR (mysql-connector-java-x.x.x.jar) in the lib directory of Tomcat.

The MySQL Connector/JAR file facilitates communication between the Java application (running on Tomcat) and the MySQL database. By placing it in the lib directory, Tomcat can access the necessary classes and functions to establish database connections and execute SQL queries.

Ensure that the MySQL Connector/JAR version matches the MySQL server version installed on your system to avoid compatibility issues.
